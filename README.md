# Fox Audio

## About

Fox Audio is a simple CLI utility for recording and playback multitrack audio straight 
to disk as either WAV or (eventually) RF64 format files. It requires that the [JACK audio server](http://jackaudio.org/) be installed and running when executed.

## Purpose

I frequently run live production and need a simple way to record multi track audio direct out of a digital sound board. Now, many people have this ability directly in the board to write to a SD card - but I do not. At the time of this writing, I am primarily mixing on a number of X32 boards that do not have the X-LIVE card installed, and I am not about to take one with me in my gig bag and install it in every board I use, so I opted to (sorta) create this - more on this further down.
